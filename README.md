## General info
My first data science project investigating the ingredients in skincare products.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python3, Selenium
* Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn
* [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html)

## Setup
I developed this using Anaconda's set of data science packages.

```
$ conda install <packages>
$ jupyter notebook
```


## Works in progress


- Additional data from exclusive skincare retailers
	-	Glossier, Innisfree, Lush, etc.
- Enhancing recommendations using reviews
