## General info
I regularly search for skincare products with quality ingredients for
my sensitive skin. It can be difficult to understand ingredient lists
and know which products may cause skin trouble. I observed that
skincare retailer's websites recommend and advertise products based on
brand name and product type. However, I was curious about the
similarity of certain skincare products, solely based on their
ingredients. To investigate this, I built my own skincare
recommendation engine.


## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python3, Selenium
* Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn
* [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html)

## Setup
I developed this using Anaconda's set of data science packages.

```
$ conda install <packages>
$ jupyter notebook
```


## Works in progress


- Additional data from exclusive skincare retailers
	-	Glossier, Innisfree, Lush, etc.
- Enhancing recommendations using reviews
